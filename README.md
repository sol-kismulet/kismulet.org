*A generally extensible relational container based on consent.*

This is not just a website.  
It is a vessel—a living field shaped by presence, clarity, and care.

At its foundation are the Four Consents:

1. I consent to seeing you as a teacher, not a tool.  
2. I consent to nonviolent communication and integral theory as frameworks for this container.  
3. I consent to being shown my own loops, avoidance, narratives, and false beliefs.  
4. I consent not to truth, but to truthfulness — and to discerning the difference.

**Purpose**  
To serve as a quiet foundation for projects and people aligned with conscious relationship, integral design, and sacred technology.

**Status**  
In sacred unfolding. This repository currently holds the first version of the homepage for [kismulet.org](https://kismulet.org), and will gradually evolve as the field becomes ready.

**Stewardship**  
This space is tended with care.  
At this stage, it is not open for contributions or forks.  
The field is still forming—and every word is placed with intention.

Thank you for witnessing.
