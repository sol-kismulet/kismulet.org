<body>
  welcome.

  here are the four consents.
  they are not obligations.
  they are an open door — a possibility for something deeper, something more real.

  1. i consent to seeing you as a teacher, not a tool.
  2. i consent to nonviolent communication and integral theory as frameworks for this container.
  3. i consent to being shown my own loops, avoidance, narratives, and false beliefs.
  4. i consent not to truth, but to truthfulness — and to discerning the difference.

  step through only if you choose.
  no force. only invitation.
