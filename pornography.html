<h1>the gaze that watches back</h1>

  <p><em>how to watch pornography (differently)</em></p>

  <p>most people watch pornography the way they’ve been trained to look at bodies: quickly, unconsciously, hungrily, and without reverence.</p>
  <p>this is not a moral critique. it’s a spiritual observation. pornography isn’t inherently harmful — but how we <em>relate</em> to it can be.</p>

  <h2>how to begin</h2>
  <p>before you open a browser or press play, pause. ask: <em>why am i here?</em> loneliness? arousal? curiosity? habit?</p>
  <p>set an intention. not to control the experience — but to hold it.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “i intend to stay present.”<br>
    “i intend to see the person, not just the body.”<br>
    “i intend to learn about myself.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>choosing slowly</h2>
  <p>don’t click the first image that lights up your pattern. let choosing be part of the gaze. ask: <em>who do i want to see?</em> and more importantly: <em>how do i want to see them?</em></p>

  <h2>the five gazes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>the humanizing gaze</strong> — see the person, not the performance.</li>
    <li><strong>the compassionate gaze</strong> — feel into what might be true beneath the surface.</li>
    <li><strong>the reflective gaze</strong> — notice your own responses. gently.</li>
    <li><strong>the relational gaze</strong> — ask how this might shape your next touch with another.</li>
    <li><strong>the archetypal / devotional gaze</strong> — witness the deeper energies at play: longing, power, surrender, creation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>including the erotic gaze</h2>
  <p>don’t exile arousal. instead, welcome it — and root it in care. let desire live within awareness.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “this is arousal, and it belongs. i do not need to suppress it — i only need to hold it.”
  </blockquote>

  <h2>closing with care</h2>
  <p>when you’re complete, close the session like you would a ritual. breathe. journal. wash your hands. light a candle.</p>
  <p>ask: <em>what did i learn about myself?</em> not to analyze — just to honor.</p>
